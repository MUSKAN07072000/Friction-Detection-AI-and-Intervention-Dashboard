A major, current problem identified for Contentsquare and its clients in 2025 is the high rate of user frustration and abandoned digital sessions, directly impacting conversion rates and return on digital ad spend. Businesses are spending more on acquiring customers, but nearly 40% of all online visits face user frustration—driven by issues such as slow-loading pages, rage clicks, and complex or unpersonalized experiences. These frustration points cause 53% of users to exit after viewing just a single page, resulting in a 6.1% drop in conversion rates year-over-year.

Another pressing issue is the "experience gap"—the difference between what users expect (fast, seamless, and personalized experiences) and what they actually encounter on websites and apps. Key behavioral pain points include:

Slow page load times

Unintuitive forms and fields

Lack of personalized content and recommendations

Friction in the buying or booking process (such as no progress trackers for multi-step flows)

Insufficient feedback or error handling

So this app is for solving these problems.Below is the list of things it solves in real time.

& An AI-driven module that monitors live user sessions and immediately identifies signs of frustration (e.g., rapid clicks, extended pauses, form abandonment).

& When frustration is detected, the system could trigger in-context help (such as a chatbot, live human support, or quick-access guides) or dynamically simplify the interface.

& This tool could also provide instant feedback to the UX team, offering both aggregated trend analytics and session-level replay for rapid iteration.
